The idea was first mentioned on  as a possible way to trick spam bots who try to use the Drupal contact form. I don't particulary like the extra step humans are required to perform in these ""verification"" methods, and some just don't work.</p><p>The idea is simple: Basically you place a bogus input field on a contact form, and use CSS to not display it. On submission you check for a value. If there is a value entered, then that means a non-human has been blanketing form fields, and the form post can be ignored as spam. The spam bot will probably never know.</p><p>Gotcha adds a field labeled ""Subject"" at the top of the contact form. It uses a ""div"" tag to render the field as ""display: none"" so human users shouldn't see it, and won't enter any data there. Hopefully, the suspected spam bot will see ""Subject"" and be enticed to enter something there. There is descriptive text to encourage a human (whose browser might be set to display it anyway) to ignore this field.</p><p>Gotcha intercepts the contact form submission and checks the hidden field.  If something is there, Gotcha simply returns to the front page and ignores the message.  The attempt is logged, along with the submitter's IP address, and the suspect message is saved in the database.  If the field is empty, then the message is passed on through to the contact module for normal processing.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the spam was still getting through. And most of that was a bunch of links to drugs or porn. From exerience, I knew that the  module was already good at dealing with this in comments.

More specifically, all logged in users will use HTTPS for their entire session, while anonymous users will use HTTP.</p><p>This configuration is often used to balance performance and security as HTTP pages offer much faster response times. Search engine optimization is also another big reason to have mixed security, as SEOs will encourage you to have HTTP rather than HTTPS pages indexed by search engines.</p><p>A potential issue in using such a configuration is session hijacking. This can happen when a user logs in on a HTTPS page but later navigates to a HTTP page. Under this scenario, the user's session cookie is sent unencrypted and in the clear. A potential attacker can steal this cookie and use it to gain access to the secure pages of the site.</p>","http://drupal.org/project/session443","","1","Modules","Modules","1272530869"
